# :house: About

This repository contains the _activities_ and _projects_ developed during the **MJV School - Angular**.

**Typescript** was the programming language used throughout the project.

**Sass** and **Angular Material** were used for styles.

**Angular Components** and **Angular Modules** were explored for better project organization and division of responsibilities along with the use of **Angular Services**, **Angular Router** routing.

Used **Angular Directives**, **Angular Event Binding** and **Angular Pipes** to compose the communication between the visual part and the logical part.

**Angular Guards** was used to ensure routing integrity.

**Angular React** Forms* was used for the forms.

**Angular HTTP** Client*, along with **RxJs** for http requests.

**Json Server** was used to simulate an api.

**UUID** was used to generate the ids.

In some of them **NextJs** was used with **ReactJs** to visually demonstrate the behavior of **RxJs**.
