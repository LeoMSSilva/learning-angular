# :house: About

This repository contains the _activities_ and _projects_ developed during the **MJV School - Angular**.

This project is a site with the order of ***Marvel*** films and series.

**Typescript** was the programming language used throughout the project.

**Sass** was used for styles.

**Angular Components** and **Angular Modules** were explored for better project organization and division of responsibilities along with the use of **Angular Services**, **Angular Router** routing.

Used **Angular Directives**, **Angular Event Binding** and **Angular Pipes** to compose the communication between the visual part and the logical part.

**Angular HTTP Client**, along with **RxJs** for http requests.

**Json Server** was used to simulate an api.
