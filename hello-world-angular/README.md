# :house: About

This repository contains the _activities_ and _projects_ developed during the **MJV School - Angular**.

This project deals with the first ***hello world*** with angular.

**Typescript** was the programming language used throughout the project.

**Sass** was used for styles.

**Angular Components** and **Angular Modules** were explored for better project organization and division of responsibilities.

Used **Angular Directives**, **Angular Event Binding** and **Angular Pipes** to compose the communication between the visual part and the logical part.
